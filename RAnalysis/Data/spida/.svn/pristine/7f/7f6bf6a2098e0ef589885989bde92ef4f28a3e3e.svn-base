\title{
Effectiveness of migraine treatment
}
\description{
Subset of data on migraine treatments collected by Tammy Kostecki-Dillon. The data consists of headache logs kept by 133 patients in
a treatment program in which bio-feedback was used to attempt to reduce migraine frequency and severity. Patients entered the program at different times
over a period of about 3 years. Patients were encouraged to begin their logs four weeks before the onset of treatment and to continue for one month afterwards,
but only 55 patients have data preceding the onset of treatment.
