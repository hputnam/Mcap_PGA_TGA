Structure: Longitudinal, up to 5 occasions on 66 depressed subjects

To illustrate an HLM application, we will consider
data from a psychiatric study described in Reisby
et al. (1977). This study focused on the longitudinal
relationship between imipramine (IMI) and
desipramine (DMI) plasma levels and clinical response
in 66 depressed inpatients. Imipramine is the prototypic
drug in the series of compounds known as
tricyclic antidepressants and is commonly prescribed
for the treatment of major depression (Seiden &
Dykstra, 1977). Because imipramine biotransforms
into the active metabolite desmethylimipramine (or
desipramine), measurement of desipramine was also
done in this study. Major depression is often classified
in terms of two types. The first type, nonendogenous
or reactive depression, is associated with
some tragic life event such as the death of a close
friend or family member, whereas the second type,
endogenous depression, is not a result of any specific
event and appears to occur spontaneously. It is
sometimes held that antidepressant medications are
more effective for endogenous depression (Willner,
1985). In this sample, 29 patients were classified as
nonendogenous, and the remaining 37 patients were
deemed to be endogenous.

The study design was as follows. Following a
placebo period of 1 week, patients received 225-mg/
day doses of imipramine for 4 weeks. In this study,
subjects were rated with the Hamilton depression (HD)
rating scale (Hamilton, 1960) twice during the baseline
placebo week (at the start and end of this week), as well
as at the end of each of the 4 treatment weeks of the
study. Plasma level measurements of both IMI and its
metabolite DMI were made at the end of each treatment
week. The sex and age of each patient were recorded,
and a diagnosis of endogenous or nonendogenous
depression was made for each patient. Although
the total number of subjects in this study was 66, the
number of subjects with all measures at each of the
weeks fluctuated: 61 atWeek 0 (start of placebo week),
63 at Week 1 (end of placebo week), 65 at Week 2
(end of first drug treatment week), 65 at Week 3 (end
of second drug treatment week), 63 at Week 4 (end of
third drug treatment week), and 58 at Week 5 (end of
fourth drug treatment week). Of the 66 subjects, only
46 had complete data at all time points. Thus, complete
case analysis under repeated-measures MANOVA, for
example, would discard approximately one third of
the data set. HLM, alternatively, uses the data that are
available from all 66 subjects.

Note from http://healthnet.umassmed.edu/mhealth/HAMD.pdf
Hamilton Scale goes from 0 to 60
For the 17-item version, scores can range from 0 to 54.
One formulation suggests that scores between 0 and 6
indicate a normal person with regard to depression,
scores between 7 and 17 indicate mild depression,
scores between 18 and 24 indicate moderate depression,
and scores over 24 indicate severe depression.
